## Algorithm Explanation

The algorithm uses **dynamic programming** to determine if Abhimanyu can escape. The dynamic programming table is defined as a 5D vector `dp` which stores intermediate results to avoid recomputation. The dimensions of `dp` represent:

1. The current circle.
2. Abhimanyu's current energy.
3. The number of skips left.
4. The number of recharges left.
5. Whether the previous enemy attacked from behind.

The recursive function `canEscape` checks:

1. **Base Case**: If Abhimanyu has crossed all circles, return `true`.
2. **Energy Check**: If Abhimanyu's energy is insufficient, and no skips or recharges are available, return `false`.
3. **Battle**: If Abhimanyu has sufficient energy, simulate the battle and recurse to the next circle.
4. **Skip**: If skips are available, recurse to the next circle without battling.
5. **Recharge**: If recharges are available, recharge Abhimanyu's energy and recurse.
### Handling Special Cases: 3rd and 7th Circles

The 3rd and 7th circles (4th and 8th in 1-based indexing) are special because the enemies here can regenerate and attack Abhimanyu from behind. Here's how these cases are handled:

- When Abhimanyu enters the 4th or 8th circle (`current_circle == 3` or `current_circle == 7` in 0-based indexing):
  - If Abhimanyu was attacked from behind in the previous circle (`prev_attacked` is `true`), the power required to cross the current circle (`curPowerNeed`) is increased by half the power of the previous enemy.
  - This adjustment simulates the behind-the-back attack by the regenerated enemy.

This ensures that Abhimanyu's energy is appropriately reduced when facing these special enemies, making the algorithm more robust and accurate.


### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm is `O(n * p * a * b * 2)`, where `n` is the number of circles, `p` is the initial energy, `a` is the number of skips, and `b` is the number of recharges. The additional factor of `2` accounts for the boolean flag indicating if the previous enemy attacked.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is `O(n * p * a * b * 2)` due to the 5D DP vector used to store results for each state.

## Test Cases


### Test Case 1:
- **Initial Energy (p)**: 50
- **Skips (a)**: 1
- **Recharges (b)**: 1
- **Enemy Powers (k)**: 46, 5, 4, 10, 9, 4, 2, 1, 40, 1, 2
- **Expected Output:** Abhimanyu cannot cross the Chakravyuha.
**Steps:**
1. **Circle 1**: Abhimanyu battles with an enemy of power 46. Remaining energy = 4.
2. **Recharge**: Abhimanyu recharges to full energy (50).
3. **Circle 2**: Abhimanyu battles with an enemy of power 5. Remaining energy = 45.
4. **Circle 3**: Abhimanyu battles with an enemy of power 4. Remaining energy = 41.
5. **Circle 4**: Abhimanyu battles with an enemy of power 12 (10 + half of previous power). Remaining energy = 29.
6. **Circle 5**: Abhimanyu battles with an enemy of power 9. Remaining energy = 20.
7. **Circle 6**:  Abhimanyu battles with an enemy of power 4. Remaining energy = 16.
8. **Circle 7**: Abhimanyu battles with an enemy of power 2. Remaining energy = 14.
9. **Circle 8**: Abhimanyu battles with an enemy of power 3 (1 + half of previous power). Remaining energy = 12.
10. **Circle 9**: Abhimanyu skips this circle.
11. **Circle 10**: Abhimanyu battles with an enemy of power 1. Remaining energy = 11.
12. **Circle 11**: Abhimanyu battles with an enemy of power 2. Remaining energy = 9.

### Test Case 2
- **Input:**
  - `p: 150`
  - `a: 3`
  - `b: 2`
  - `k: 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 5`
- **Expected Output:** Abhimanyu cannot cross the Chakravyuha.
- **Explanation:** 
  - Abhimanyu starts with 150 power and defeats the first enemy with 100 power, leaving him with 50 power.
  - Despite using his recharges and skips strategically, the cumulative effect of powerful enemies depletes his energy, especially with the regeneration of the 4th and 8th circle enemies, leading to his defeat.

## Conclusion
This algorithm efficiently determines whether Abhimanyu can successfully cross all circles in the Chakravyuha based on the given inputs. The dynamic programming approach ensures optimal performance, considering all possible paths and scenarios.
