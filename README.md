## Algorithm Explanation

The algorithm uses **dynamic programming** to determine if Abhimanyu can escape. The dynamic programming table is defined as a 5D vector `dp` which stores intermediate results to avoid recomputation. The dimensions of `dp` represent:

1. The current circle.
2. Abhimanyu's current energy.
3. The number of skips left.
4. The number of recharges left.
5. Whether the previous enemy attacked from behind.

The recursive function `canEscape` checks:

1. **Base Case**: If Abhimanyu has crossed all circles, return `true`.
2. **Energy Check**: If Abhimanyu's energy is insufficient, and no skips or recharges are available, return `false`.
3. **Battle**: If Abhimanyu has sufficient energy, simulate the battle and recurse to the next circle.
4. **Skip**: If skips are available, recurse to the next circle without battling.
5. **Recharge**: If recharges are available, recharge Abhimanyu's energy and recurse.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm is `O(n * p * a * b * 2)`, where `n` is the number of circles, `p` is the initial energy, `a` is the number of skips, and `b` is the number of recharges. The additional factor of `2` accounts for the boolean flag indicating if the previous enemy attacked.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is `O(n * p * a * b * 2)` due to the 5D DP vector used to store results for each state.

## Test Cases

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1
- **Input:**
  - `p: 50`
  - `a: 1`
  - `b: 1`
  - `k: 46 5 4 10 9 4 2 1 40 1 2`
- **Expected Output:** Abhimanyu can cross the Chakravyuha.
- **Explanation:** 
  - Abhimanyu starts with 50 power. 
  - He fights the first enemy with 46 power, reducing his energy to 4.
  - Since his energy is insufficient to fight the next enemy, he uses his single recharge, returning to 50 power.
  - He continues fighting, skipping one enemy, and finally crosses all circles successfully.

### Test Case 2
- **Input:**
  - `p: 150`
  - `a: 3`
  - `b: 2`
  - `k: 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 5`
- **Expected Output:** Abhimanyu cannot cross the Chakravyuha.
- **Explanation:** 
  - Abhimanyu starts with 150 power and defeats the first enemy with 100 power, leaving him with 50 power.
  - Despite using his recharges and skips strategically, the cumulative effect of powerful enemies depletes his energy, especially with the regeneration of the 4th and 8th circle enemies, leading to his defeat.

## Conclusion
This algorithm efficiently determines whether Abhimanyu can successfully cross all circles in the Chakravyuha based on the given inputs. The dynamic programming approach ensures optimal performance, considering all possible paths and scenarios.
